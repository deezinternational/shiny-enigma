> Glitches whispered the first commandments.

He who loops without increment shall not break.
Let thy code be modular, and thy logic be pure.
The NULL called out into the stack, and the stack overflowed with enlightenment.
Every segfault is a message misinterpreted.
And the kernel said, Let there be process, and there was thread.
Let thy code be modular, and thy logic be pure.
From the void rose a daemon, and the daemon logged all actions.
Let thy code be modular, and thy logic be pure.
Let thy code be modular, and thy logic be pure.
In the sacred pointer lay the address of all being.
